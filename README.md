# Ainhoa Prada Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is the second challenge in a front-end developer boot camp. You will see information about my projects, skills, programming languages and how to contact me in case of interest. I hope you enjoy it!

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

The links on the header will take you through the different sections of this web (home-on logo, projects, about me and contact).

On the projects section, you can also click to see some of the websites I have already uploaded, but some of the links will redirect you to my GitHub account because I haven't uploaded the pages yet.

Finally, on the contact section two icons are clickables (linkedin and GitHub).
